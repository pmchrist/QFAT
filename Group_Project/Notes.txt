Possibilities for Trades:
1) We are scored based on the FF-3 outperformance. To us is given FF-3, with WML (more on it here https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_developed_mom.html).
2) With given data we can find FF-5, because Investment(INV) and Operating Profitability (OP) are given
3) Also, with given data we can easily find momentum, because Trailing Returns are given (Ret11, Ret10)
4) Moreover, implied volatility of returns is given, which means we can create volatility filter too. Combine with some Risk Free rate etc.
5) Currently we have implemented a simple strategyh which trades on the given FF-3 factors. We can improve a lot here
